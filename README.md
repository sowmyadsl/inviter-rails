# Inviter
(Still under development..)

## A Rails web application to invite people and send invitations to the attendees. Also added authentication for users to signup and create events and send invites using action mailer.

##Landing page:

![screenshot](https://github.com/sowmyadsl/inviter-rails/blob/master/public/screencapture-localhost-3000-1501178900106.png)

It handles the following user stories:

- As a user, I'd like to visit the splash page and view the description of the web page.
- As a user, I'd like to navigate to about page and view the about page.
- As a user, I'd like to be able to signup, signin and logout of the application.
- As a user, I'd like to be able to create, edit, update and delete events.
- As a user, I'd like to be able to add, edit, update and delete attendees.
- As a user, I'd like to be able to view all events on a page.

Further Explorations:

- [x] Add AJAX to add an attendee.
- [x] Add AJAX to delete an attendee.
- [x] Add Actionmailer to deliver the invite to attendee's email address. But I used letter opener(for now), Planning to use mail gun and SMTP for production.
- [ ] Add AJAX to add, delete and update an event.
- [ ] Add AJAX to edit an attendee.
- [ ] Add admin functionality to add,edit and delete templates and integrate the templates with events on the splash page.
- [ ] Add search scope to search from a list of categories to choose the templates for events.
- [ ] Add RSVP status and keep track of the RSVP status and update on the event page.
